# About clj-easy

This organization was created to collaborate on small utilities or documentation
projects that are of general use for the Clojure community and aren't large
enough to be hosted in a separate organization like
[babashka](https://github.com/babashka/babashka) or
[clj-kondo](https://github.com/clj-kondo/clj-kondo). Typical examples:

- [graal-docs](https://github.com/clj-easy/graal-docs)
- [graal-build-time](https://github.com/clj-easy/graal-build-time)

# The name

The name is inspired by [Simple made easy](https://youtu.be/SxdOUGdseq4) by Rich
Hickey. As [knittedcastle.org](https://knittedcastle.org) was already taken, and
simple has gotten the most attention within the Clojure community in the last
decade or so, we decided to go with easy.
